In my exploration of machine learning and deep learning, I implemented several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, including SimpleCNN, GoogleNet, VGGNet, and ResNet. The objective of this project was to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset, which comprises 100 different classes of objects.

Through rigorous experimentation and optimization, I achieved a test accuracy of 76% using the ResNet architecture. This project not only enhanced my understanding of CNNs and their applications in image classification but also provided valuable insights into the nuances of architecture, learning rate and scheduler.
