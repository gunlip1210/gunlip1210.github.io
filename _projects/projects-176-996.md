In this project, we developed an application designed to detect fraudulent calls, helping users avoid falling victim to voice phishing scams. The application serves two primary functions: real-time number verification and post-call voice analysis, offering a comprehensive approach to phishing detection.

When a call is received, the application checks the caller's number against a database of suspicious or known fraudulent numbers. If the number matches, the user is immediately notified of the potential risk, allowing them to decide whether to answer or ignore the call. This instant verification layer helps users avoid high-risk calls in real time.

Once the call ends, the application conducts a detailed analysis of the recorded conversation. By using voice recognition technology, the app transcribes the audio and applies a phishing detection algorithm to the text. This algorithm scans for patterns and keywords typically associated with phishing scams, such as requests for sensitive information like banking details or threats of legal action. The results of this analysis, including a phishing risk score, are then sent to the user and stored in a secure database for future reference.

As the team leader, I played a central role in the development of this system. I was responsible for building the voice recognition and analysis APIs, ensuring they were optimized for accuracy and efficiency. I also led the integration of these APIs with the core application, streamlining the entire detection process from call reception to post-call analysis.

In addition to the technical contributions, I oversaw the overall project coordination, ensuring that all components—real-time number checking, voice recognition, phishing analysis, and database storage—worked together seamlessly. The application not only provides a powerful defense against voice phishing but also offers an intuitive user experience, making it accessible to a broad audience.
