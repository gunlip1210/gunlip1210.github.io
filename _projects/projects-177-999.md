In this project, We developed a program that converts Braille in images to text, aiding in the detection of misprinted Braille.

This system is designed to support the mobility rights of individuals with visual impairments. I played a key role in designing the architecture and algorithms, and I developed a component that recognizes Braille in images and converts it to Braille ASCII. I then integrated this with another component that converts Braille ASCII to text.
