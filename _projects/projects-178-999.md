In this project, I implemented the popular 2048 game using the C programming language. 

The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where players move numbered tiles in one of four directions (up, down, left, or right) to combine matching numbers and create larger ones. The objective is to reach the 2048 tile by strategically merging numbers. My implementation includes functions for rotating the grid, moving tiles, checking for game-over conditions, and randomly generating new tiles (2 or 4). The game continues until no more moves are possible.
