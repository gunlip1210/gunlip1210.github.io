In this project, I developed a reinforcement learning model aimed at optimizing lane-changing and speed control strategies within a highway-multi-vehicle environment. Utilizing the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm implemented in the Python Highway-env package, I trained the model to make real-time decisions that enhance traffic flow and improve safety.

Through the implementation of this model, I gained a deeper understanding of reinforcement learning concepts and their practical applications. By experimenting with various driving scenarios and vehicle interactions, I was able to observe how the model learns from its environment, improving its strategies over time. This hands-on experience not only solidified my knowledge of reinforcement learning but also underscored its potential in developing intelligent transportation systems.
